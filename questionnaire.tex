\item Please indicate roughly how many different inputs you used with the visualization? \underline{\hspace{1cm}}

\item I sought materials other than those provided by my professor to learn this algorithm.
(True / False) \\ \textsl{If True, please indicate what materials were used:}

\addtocounter{enumi}{7}%I am not sure I agree with the counting scheme, but it really isn't important to me

\item Using the visualization helped me understand the algorithm.
(Agree / Disagree)

\item The input generators for the visualization and the exercises were easy to understand and use.

(Agree / Disagree)

\item I frequently chose the correct answer for the pop-up questions on my first attempt.
(Agree / Disagree)

\item The questions were ambiguous or confusing.
(Agree / Disagree)

%Did you know we can record these statistics if we get Tom give them sign-in credentials?  Maybe too much work.  If its not already being done, we maybe should get JHAVÉ.org to start logging usage, user responses for data analysis ☺ unrelated to the task at hand though.

\item I consider myself a visual learner.
(Agree / Disagree)

\section*{Question Questions}

\item I frequently guessed on the pop-up questions.
(Agree / Disagree)

\item The questions were ambiguous or confusing.%I want this one since some of the questions are tricky
(Agree / Disagree)

\section*{Other Questions}

\item The use of colors in the visualization was confusing or unclear.
(Agree / Disagree) % / I'm colorblind you insensitive clod) %lol

\item The input generator was easy to understand and use.%This one because the exercises haven't been as thoroughly examined as the visualization
(Agree / Disagree)

\item I read through some parts of the hypertext book more than once to improve my understanding of the topic.
(True) (False)

\item The guide was informative and helpful for setting up and using the visualization.
(Agree / Disagree) (This question is for our own reference and will not be analysed for research purposes) %Do we tell them that?

\end{comment}

\end{enumerate}

%These will be helpful for us but open ended questions will be hard to use in analysis unless many users say the same thing
