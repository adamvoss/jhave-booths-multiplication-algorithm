\section*{Question Questions}

\item I frequently chose  the correct answer for the pop-up questions on my first attempt.
(Agree) (Disagree)
%Did you know we can record these statistics if we get Tom give them sign-in credentials?  Maybe too much work.  If its not already being done, we maybe should get JHAVÉ.org to start logging usage, user responses for data analysis ☺ unrelated to the task at hand though.

\item I frequently guessed on the pop-up questions.
(Agree) (Disagree)

\item The questions were ambiguous or confusing.
(Agree) (Disagree)

\section*{Other Questions}

\item The use of colors in the visualization was confusing or unclear.
(Agree) (Disagree) %(I'm colorblind you insensitive clod)

\item The input generator was easy to understand and use.
(Agree) (Disagree)

\item I read through some parts of the hypertext book more than once to improve my understanding of the topic.
(True) (False)


\item The guide was informative and helpful for setting up and using the visualization.
(Agree) (Disagree) (This question is for our own reference and will not be analysed for research purposes) %Do we tell them that?

%These will be helpful for us but open ended questions will be hard to use in analysis unless many users say the same thing
\section*{Comments}
