\item Do you consider yourself a visual learner?

\item Using the visualization helped me learn and understand the algorithm (Agree) (Disagree)

(could ask the same question about specific features but not sure which ones to care about)

\item The hypertextbook was helpful in understanding how and why the algorithm works
"                   " unclear or ambiguous in some sections

\item I read through some parts of the hypertext book more than once to improve my understanding of the topic

\item The guide was informative and helpful for setting up and using the visualization (for our own reference, not for research) %Do we tell them that?

\item Rank the following items with respect to how helpful you thought they were:
Use 1 for the most helpful, 5 for the least.
  The visualization pictures
  The pseudo-code tab
  The info tab
  The pop-up questions
  The color scheme (???)
  The exercises

\item The use of colors in the visualization was confusing or unclear

\item I frequently chose or gave the correct answer for the pop-up questions on my first attempt %What does this show?  Did you know we can record these statistics if we get Tom give them sign-in credentials?  Maybe too much work.  If its not already being done, we maybe should get JHAVÉ.org to start logging usage, user responses for data analysis ☺ unrelated to the task at hand though.

\item I frequently guessed on the pop-up questions.

\item The questions were ambiguous or confusing

\item The input generator was easy to understand and use

\item I ran visualizations for multiple inputs to better understand the algorithm.
(Maybe ask how many, roughly)


\item I could have learned the algorithm without the use of the visualization.
(Just a little more formal)


%These will be helpful for us but open ended questions will be hard to use in analysis unless many users say the same thing
