\item I consider myself a visual learner.
(Agree) (Disagree)

\item I sought materials other than those provided by my professor to learn this algorithm.
(True) (False)

If True, please indicate what materials were used.

\item Please indicate roughly how many different inputs you used with the visualization? \_\_\_\_

\section*{Question Questions}

\item I frequently chose  the correct answer for the pop-up questions on my first attempt.
(Agree) (Disagree)
%What does this show?  Did you know we can record these statistics if we get Tom give them sign-in credentials?  Maybe too much work.  If its not already being done, we maybe should get JHAVÉ.org to start logging usage, user responses for data analysis ☺ unrelated to the task at hand though.

\item I frequently guessed on the pop-up questions.
(Agree) (Disagree)

\item The questions were ambiguous or confusing.
(Agree) (Disagree)

\section*{Other Questions}

\item The use of colors in the visualization was confusing or unclear.
(Agree) (Disagree) %(I'm colorblind you insensitive clod)

\item The input generator was easy to understand and use.
(Agree) (Disagree)


\item I could have learned the algorithm without the use of the visualization.
(Just a little more formal)

\item The hypertextbook was helpful in understanding how and why the algorithm works
"                   " unclear or ambiguous in some sections

\item I read through some parts of the hypertext book more than once to improve my understanding of the topic (True) (False)

\item The guide was informative and helpful for setting up and using the visualization (for our own reference, not for research) %Do we tell them that?

%These will be helpful for us but open ended questions will be hard to use in analysis unless many users say the same thing
