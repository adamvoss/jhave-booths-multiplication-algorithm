Multiply two binary numbers

Leave the multiplicand unchanged.
You may want to calculate the two's complement of the multiplicand.
Encode the multiplier using Booth's encoding
Multiply the multiplicand using the encoded multiplier.


Booth Encode a Binary Number

Scan the digits from right to left:
    Copy down zeros as 0.
    At the first 1 encountered, copy down ī.
    Continue on, flipping all 1s to 0s.
    When the first 0 is encountered copy down 1.
    Go to line 2


Multiplying using a booth-encoded multiplier

Multiply by digit as with regular multiplication.
    If the digit is ī, the result of the multiplication is the two's complement of M
Before summing the partial products
    Sign extend all the partial products so they have the same number of digits as the last partial product.
Sum the partial products.
