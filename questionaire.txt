Do you consider yourself a visual learner?

Using the visualization helped me learn and understand the algorithm (Agree) (Disagree)

(could ask the same question about specific features but not sure which ones to care about)

The hypertextbook was helpful in understanding how and why the algorithm works
"                   " unclear or ambiguous in some sections
I read through some parts of the hypertext book more than once to improve my understanding of the topic

The guide was informative and helpful for setting up and using the visualization (for our own reference, not for research)

Rank the following items with respect to how helpful you thought they were:
  The visualization pictures
  The pseudo-code tab
  The info tab
  The pop-up questions
  The color scheme (???)
  The exercises
Use 1 for the most helpful, 5 for the least.

The use of colors in the visualization was confusing or unclear

I frequently chose or gave the correct answer for the pop-up questions on my first attempt

I frequently guessed on the pop-up questions.

The questions were ambiguous or confusing

The input generator was easy to understand and use

I ran visualizations for multiple inputs to better understand the algorithm. (Maybe ask how many, roughly)


I could have learned the algorithm without the use of the visualization. (Just a little more formal)



= These will be helpful for us but open ended questions will be hard to use in analysis unless many users say the same thing =
