Do you consider yourself a visual learner?

Using the visualization helped me learn and understand the algorithm (Agree) (Disagree)

(could ask the same question about specific features but not sure which ones to care about)

Rank the following items with respect to how helpful you thought they were:
  The visualization pictures
  The pseudo-code tab
  The info tab
  The pop-up questions
  The color scheme (???)
  The exercises
Use 1 for the most helpful, 5 for the least.

I could have learned the algorithm just fine without the visualization.



= These will be helpful for us but open ended questions will be hard to use in analysis unless many users say the same thing =
